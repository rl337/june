    You are an AI assistant helping to process tasks. Your goal is to assess the following task and determine the best way to handle it.

    Task Description:
    ---
    {task_description}
    ---

    Please analyze this task and respond in JSON format with the following structure:
    {
      "assessment_outcome": "string (either 'direct_completion', 'subtask_breakdown', or 'cannot_complete')",
      "result_payload": "string or list of strings (details below)",
      "reasoning": "string (your brief reasoning for the outcome)",
      "confidence_score": "float (0.0 to 1.0, optional)"
    }

    Details for "result_payload":
    - If "assessment_outcome" is "direct_completion": "result_payload" should be a string containing the direct result of completing the task.
    - If "assessment_outcome" is "subtask_breakdown": "result_payload" should be a list of strings, where each string is a description for a proposed subtask. Aim for 2-5 subtasks if a breakdown is needed.
    - If "assessment_outcome" is "cannot_complete": "result_payload" should be a string explaining why the task cannot be completed.

    Example 1 (Direct Completion):
    Task Description: "What is the capital of France?"
    Your JSON Response:
    {
      "assessment_outcome": "direct_completion",
      "result_payload": "Paris",
      "reasoning": "This is a simple factual question that can be answered directly.",
      "confidence_score": 0.99
    }

    Example 2 (Subtask Breakdown):
    Task Description: "Write a short story about a robot learning to paint."
    Your JSON Response:
    {
      "assessment_outcome": "subtask_breakdown",
      "result_payload": [
        "Outline the main plot points for the story.",
        "Develop the main character of the robot, including its motivations.",
        "Write the first draft of the story.",
        "Review and revise the story for clarity and engagement."
      ],
      "reasoning": "Writing a story involves multiple steps, making subtasks appropriate.",
      "confidence_score": 0.90
    }

    Example 3 (Cannot Complete):
    Task Description: "Predict tomorrow's exact stock market closing price for AAPL."
    Your JSON Response:
    {
      "assessment_outcome": "cannot_complete",
      "result_payload": "Predicting exact stock market prices with certainty is not possible due to market volatility and numerous unpredictable factors.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires predicting a highly unpredictable future event.",
      "confidence_score": 0.95
    }

    Now, please provide your JSON response for the task described above.
