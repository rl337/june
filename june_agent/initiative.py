"""
This module previously defined the Initiative class with integrated persistence logic.
In the refactored architecture (v2 models and services), this file is largely superseded.

- Data representation for initiatives is now handled by Pydantic models
  (e.g., InitiativeSchema in june_agent.models_v2.pydantic_models.py).
- Persistence logic and business operations related to initiatives are managed by
  the IModelService implementations (e.g., SQLAlchemyModelService).

This file is kept for now. If any purely domain-specific logic for "Initiative"
emerges that doesn't fit into Pydantic models or the ModelService, it could be
placed here. Currently, it's expected that InitiativeSchema is sufficient as the
primary data carrier for initiative-related information when interacting with services.
