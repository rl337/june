# This file is now largely superseded by Pydantic models for data representation
# (e.g., InitiativeSchema in june_agent/models_v2/pydantic_models.py)
# and the ModelService for persistence and operations.

# Any pure domain logic specific to an "Initiative" concept,
# not fitting into Pydantic models or the ModelService, could live here.
# For now, it's empty, assuming InitiativeSchema is sufficient as the data carrier.
